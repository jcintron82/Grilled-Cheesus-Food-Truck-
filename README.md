# This is a simple website I created for a restaurant/food truck. This project was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript with a heavy
emphasis on using Webpack and the compiler for the files. The main personal goal for this site was to get familiar with webpacks innerworkings
and how to get into an efficient workflow when using it which I would say I successfully did.
